# IPC-144-Seneca-
Welcome to my IPC-144 repository! Here, you'll find my completed C projects, from simple programs to advanced applications with code and documentation. Instructions for compiling and running programs are in the pdf folder. My goal is to share my learning journey and inspire others to learn C. Do not use this projects for presenting as your own.
