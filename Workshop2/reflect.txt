For the first Question : small nodifications such as 17.96 and 17.96f are the cases which makes a big difference. such as printing 17.959999 for 17.96f and 17.960000 for 17.96 just that and which makes a difference in our answer.

For the second question : These code was casted perfectly and the only reason this code was explicit was because it was made by using coercion method and it had everything fixed unlike other examples which were implicit.

For the third question : The Value is casted to be $72 which is explicit because of rounding up the float value and also this code its also, all the values for 1,2,3 and 4 are same. For the 1st and 3rd sample we have to put the %d for getting the answer instead of so that we can do the truncation the money for printing the value .
