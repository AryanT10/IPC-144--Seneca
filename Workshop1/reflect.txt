Yes, I do have some experience with C language, HTML and CSS and also I am still learning JS.
I am using VS code and compiling is pretty easy in VS code, it's far better than other applications and also VS code consists of many tools which can help a programmer.
I want to grow myself and excel in this program, I had past good experience with programming and I would love to go in depth and learn more about this course, I love learning new things and this is one of the best thing I can achieve.
